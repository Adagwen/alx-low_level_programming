A variadic function in the C programming language is a function that can accept a variable number of arguments. These functions use the <stdarg.h> header and the ellipsis (...) syntax to handle a flexible number of arguments. Here's a summary:

Variadic functions can accept a variable number of arguments, allowing for flexibility in the number of parameters passed.

They are commonly used for tasks like formatting and printing, where the number of arguments may vary.

Variadic functions use the <stdarg.h> header, which provides macros like va_list, va_start, va_arg, and va_end for handling variable arguments.

va_list is a type used to represent a list of variable arguments.

va_start initializes the va_list to the first variable argument, using a reference point defined by a fixed argument.

va_arg retrieves the next argument from the list, specifying the expected data type of the argument.

va_end cleans up the va_list after processing variable arguments.

Variadic functions offer flexibility but require careful handling to ensure that the number and types of arguments match your expectations to avoid undefined behavior. They are commonly used in C for functions like printf and custom functions that need to handle a variable number of parameters.
