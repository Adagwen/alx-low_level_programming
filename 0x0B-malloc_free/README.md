In C, malloc is used to dynamically allocate memory at runtime. It takes the number of bytes to allocate as an argument and returns a pointer to the allocated memory block. It's important to check if the returned pointer is not NULL to handle allocation failures. On the other hand, free is used to deallocate the memory previously allocated with malloc. It takes the pointer to the allocated memory block as an argument. Properly managing malloc and free ensures efficient memory usage and helps prevent memory leaks in C programs.
